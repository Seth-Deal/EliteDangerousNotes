Unless you have a flight stick, play this game with an X-box controller!!!!!!!!!!

## Basic start
1. Play until you are comfortable, the starter area is nice
2. Add me on the game, and join my private session. when in my group, other players cant kill you
	a. cmdr_john_moses_browning
3. when ready to leave, take the mission "exploring the galaxy" and go to where it tells you, this gives you 100k
4. Watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X99wx9wmi6w
5. Do road to riches to the system `Ix`, dock with scully power station
	a. this station has loads of modules and ships, its a dope home base
6. Join up with the power faction Li Yong-rui (spelling might be wrong)
	a. this dude gives you a ten percent discount on ships in the systems he owns, he owns ix
7. From here, you should upgrade your FSD and buy a fuel scoop, and do a road to riches run. Make enough money to buy a DBX. Here is mine: https://inara.cz/cmdr-fleet/286150/2361622/
	a. This will let you make a fuck load of money really fast, then you can buy either a combat ship if you want to be a pirate or soldior, or a passenger ship, mining ship, cargo ship, whatever. 

## Upgrading your FSD
1. Using your DBX and the road to riches tool, plot a course to Maia
1. Once in Maia, purchase one unit of meta alloys from [Darnielle's Progress](https://eddb.io/station/47951)
1. Plot a road to riches course to Deciat if you want, or just fly there. 
1. Make contact with Falicity at Farseer's lab
1. Donate your meta alloy, and sell your exploration data
1. Pin the FSD distance upgrade, and fly back to IX. Now you need a ship.
	a. Buy this https://inara.cz/cmdr-fleet/286150/2421388/
